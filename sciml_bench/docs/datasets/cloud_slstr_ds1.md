cloud_slstr_ds1 is a small  but real remote sensing dataset from the SLSTR instrument of the Sentinel-3 satellite. The dataset is made up of two parts: reflectance and brightness temperature. The reflectance is captured across six channels with the resolution of 2400 x 3000 pixels, and the brightness temperature is captured across three channels with the resolution of 1200 x 1500 pixels.

Data Source: Sentinel-3 SLSTR Satellite Data (CEDA)
Main Domain: Environmental Sciences
Sub Domain : Atmospheric Sciences
Data Type:	Images [2400 x 3000 x 6] and [1200 x 1500 x 3]
Data Size:	187 GB

cloud_slstr_ds1 is a small  but real remote sensing dataset from the SLSTR instrument of the Sentinel-3 satellite. The dataset is made up of two parts: reflectance and brightness temperature. This dataset can be used to estimate the sea surface temperature (SST). The reflectance is captured across six channels with the resolution of 2400 x 3000 pixels, and the brightness temperature is captured across three channels with the resolution of 1200 x 1500 pixels.
