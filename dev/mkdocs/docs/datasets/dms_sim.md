# dms_sim Dataset

dms_sim is a simulated dataset containing 8,060 diffuse multiple scattering patterns for a material, coming from older generation detectors (dimensions of 487x195, with three channels). Thus, each scattering pattern is of size 487x195x3. The data relates to two possible crystal structures monoclinic and tetragonal structures and contains simulated patterns for each phase. There are 4,030 examples of each lattice in the training data.  
The data was generated using the DMS simulator code [1]. 


* Data Source: Simulated
* Main Domain: Material Sciences
* Sub Domain:	Condensed Matter Physics
* Data Type:	Images [487 x 195 x 3]
* Enclosing Benchmark: dms_structure
* Data Size	8.6 GB
