# SciML Benchmark Suite - Credits

## Core Framework 

The core benchmarking framework is developed by the [Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Group](https://bityl.co/67iG) at the [Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL)](https://bit.ly/2FA5X5l), [Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://stfc.ukri.org/index.cfm), UK.

## Benchmarks 

This release of the benchmark suite consists of three benchmarks, namely, *cloud_slstr*, *dms_structure*, and *em_denoise*.

* The *cloud_slstr* benchmark was developed by Samuel Jackson, Caroline Cox (RALSpace, STFC), Jeyan Thiyagalingam, and Tony Hey.

* The *dms_structure* benchmark was developed by Keith Butler, Gareth Nisbet (Diamond Light Source), Steve Collins (Diamond Light Source), Jeyan Thiyagalingam, and Tony Hey.

* The *em_denoise* benchmark was developed by Keith Butler, Kuangdai Leng, Patrick Austin (RAL, STFC), Jeyan Thiyagalingam, and Tony Hey.

Please consult the main documentation for details on individual benchmarks. 

## Discussions and Suggestions 

The overall scope of benchmarks, datasets and their coverage was a result of long standing discussion with the AI for Science Community at the international level. This is facilitated by various efforts, events and discussions. In particular, the activities from the Benchmarking for AI for Science at Exascale (BASE) programme has contributed a lot towards this. We are particularly thankful for the investigators of BASE, namely, Professor Ofer Lahav (University College London), Wes Armour (University of Oxford), Tim Snow (Diamond Light Source), Tom Burnley (STFC), Joe Zuntz (University of Edinburgh), and  Tomas Lazauskas (Alan Turing Institute). We are also thankful to the MLCommons Science Working Group, particularly to Christine Kirkpatrick (University of California, San Diego) for providing mirrors for our data. Various SciML Research Group members have also contributed to the discussions, code reviews and testing of the framework/suite.

## Funding

This benchmarking programme is supported by [1] Benchmarking for AI for Science at Exascale (BASE), EPSRC ExCALIBUR Phase I grant (EP/V001310/1) and [2] Wave I of the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund under the EPSRC grant (EP/T001569/1), particularly the *AI for Science* theme in that grant and the Alan Turing Institute.
